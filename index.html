                <h2>My Journey</h2>
                <p>
                    My journey into development didn’t start with a single “aha” moment - it grew out of a desire to understand how things work and how technology can solve real problems. I’ve spent years working in roles that required adaptability, communication, and leadership, which gave me a strong foundation in people skills before I ever wrote my first line of code.

                    As I began learning web development, I found myself drawn to the balance between logic and creativity. Writing code challenged me to think critically, break problems down into manageable pieces, and stay persistent when solutions weren’t obvious. Each project became an opportunity to learn - not just new syntax or tools, but better ways to think.

                    Today, I’m focused on growing as a developer by building practical projects, strengthening my fundamentals, and learning continuously. I value clean, understandable code and user-focused design, and I’m motivated by the idea that even small improvements in software can make a meaningful difference. This journey is still unfolding, and I’m excited to keep learning, building, and refining my craft.

                <h2>Outside of Work</h2>
                <p>
                    When I’m not coding or working my full-time job, I enjoy knitting, gaming, and spending time with my family. Knitting allows me to express my creativity and unwind after a day of problem-solving, while gaming keeps me connected to the latest in technology and storytelling. Spending quality time with my family is my top priority, as they provide me with support and motivation in all my endeavors. Balancing these interests with my passion for development helps me maintain a well-rounded perspective and keeps me energized for the challenges ahead.
